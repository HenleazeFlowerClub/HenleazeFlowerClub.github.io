				Henleaze and District Flower Club was formed in 1981 by a small group of flower arrangers.  We are an afternoon club,  which meets bi-monthly every 2nd and 4th Thursday afternoon at 2 to 4 pm.  We are an informal and friendly  club with around 70 members with an interest in all things Floral from watching demonstrators to practising our skills. Beginners and experienced flower arrangers are all welcome.  There is something for everyone and we are very lucky that those with a wealth of flower arranging talent and experience delight in passing on and sharing their knowledge.   
			<p>
				​The Club is part of <a href="https://www.nafas.org.uk/">NAFAS</a> (national Association of Flower Arrangement Societies) and comes under the <a href="https://www.nafas.org.uk/regions/south-west/">South West Region</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 2nd Thursday of each month there is a flower arrangement demonstrator or speaker.  Normally a demonstration comprises 5 or 6 designs. You can sit back and enjoy the live show , combining art, horticulture and theatre, followed by free coffee and tea.  The designs are usually raffled at the end and  you could be lucky enough to take an arrangement home.  Demonstrations are open to visitors at a cost of £5.  Our speakers are floral, plant or gardening related.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the 4th Thursday of each month the Club runs a practical class under the expert tutelage of our Chair Kathleen Taylor, where you can try out different designs and style in an informal friendly relaxed environment.  Members bring their own flowers , foliage and container
				Visitors and new members are always welcome.
